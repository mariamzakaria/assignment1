# Q1.

## Ex. RGB(1,5,6)

I= 1/3(R+G+B) = 4

S = 1-(3/R+G+B)(min(R,G,B)) = 0.75

Theta = cos-1 [0.5[(R-G)+(R-B)] /  [(R-G)2 + (R-B)(G-B)0.5]] = 2.951

If B<=G: 

H = Theta

else B>G:

H= 360-Theta

Therefore:

H = 357.04

### HSI (357.04,0.75,4)


# Q2.

The color matching functions sometimes they call for a negative amount of light to achieve a match, such as 520nm. 
What this means is that the test subject was unable to achieve a match using positive values of the primary lights. 
To address this, some of the primary lights were mixed in on the opposite side of the screen with the reference light, until a color match was able to be made.

As it turns out, no 3 primaries can create every spectral color.
By using the negative light trick researchers were able to quantify a color match in spectral ranges not matchable by their chosen primaries.
